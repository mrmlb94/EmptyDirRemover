# EmptyDirRemover
CleanEmptyFolders is a Python script designed to safely remove empty folders from a specified directory. This tool is useful for cleaning up directories and maintaining an organized file structure. The script carefully iterates through the directory tree, ensuring that only empty folders are removed, and handles permission errors gracefully.
