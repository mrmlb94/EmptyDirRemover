**CleanEmptyFolders**

CleanEmptyFolders is a Python script designed to safely remove empty folders from a specified directory. This tool is useful for cleaning up directories and maintaining an organized file structure. The script carefully iterates through the directory tree, ensuring that only empty folders are removed, and handles permission errors gracefully.

**Features:**
- Removes only empty folders: Ensures that no non-empty folders are accidentally deleted.
- Handles permission errors: Skips folders that the script doesn't have permission to delete and provides informative messages.
- Easy to use: Simply specify the path to the directory you want to clean up.

**Usage:**
- Clone the repository.
- Modify the directory_path variable in the script to point to the directory you want to clean.
- Run the script with appropriate permissions.
